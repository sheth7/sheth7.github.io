Complex enterprises are vulnerable to a variety of risks.  To build an appreciation of the scale and variety of enterprise risks, I built a typology using latest data mining and data organization methods used by our group at Purdue's Innovation Science Laboratory.  The typology is inspired by a [recently published paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0024630120302296) from our lab.

Have a look at the risk typology [here](/post/risk_typo/risk_typo.html). This resource is the basis for my doctoral research and in-development articles for peer-review.  Check back soon for updates on the articles.
