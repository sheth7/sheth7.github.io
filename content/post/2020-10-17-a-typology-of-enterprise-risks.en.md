Complex enterprises suffer from a variety of risks.  To build an appreciation of the scale and variety of enterprise risks, I built a typology using latest data mining and data organization methods used by our group at Purdue's Innovation Science Laboratory.

Have a look at the risk typology [here](../../widgets/risk_files/risk_typo.html). This resource is the basis for my doctoral research and in-development articles for peer-review.  Check back soon for updates on the articles.
