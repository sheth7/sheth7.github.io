2021 was the first time that a Nobel Prize was awarded for “groundbreaking contributions to our understanding of complex systems”.  As a researcher looking at organizations as Complex Adaptive Systems, I find this very exciting!

Since the award, there has been much exposition of Complex Systems Theory.  In this post, I simply explain Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) — a subset class of Complex Systems — and link to work by researchers viewing organizations as CAS toward building ‘resiliency’ in enterprises.  

Modern enterprises operate at very large scales, and although they possess management control structures such as governing boards, top-executive teams, and hierarchical accountability structures, they regularly come across complexity in some form. For example, although Google is conventionally structured, its operations cater to upwards of 5 Billion daily searches. In contrast, Wikipedia which gets about that many visits a month (still very high scale) is de-centralized and highly distinct. The unique architecture is even more clearly witnessed in the way the open-source community operates.  

To build resilience in such complex enterprises, aspiring leaders need to look at sources of competitive advantage, such as enterprise “adaptation”.  They would benefit by the CAS view.

Looking back a hundred years to the Industrial Revolution, there have been several “theories of the firm”, which attempt to explain fundamental reasons for enterprise existence and enterprise objectives. Among them, the “evolutionary theory” has made several seminal contributions most recently. It views an enterprise as a reactor to change and creator of change for competitive advantage. The Resource Based View (RBV), which stems from the evolutionary theory, has the objective of maintaining “the stability of competitive advantage” and suggests that the competitive advantage of a firm over its competitors is constrained by the resources it possesses. Yet competitive advantage has its root in phenomena such as “innovation” and “resilience”, which are not explained by the availability and access to resources. CAS provides a lens for this.

CASs are imagined as systems that are not particularly under the control of an “orchestrator” and instead  their behavior is governed in a hybrid and adapting manner via interactions between systems elements and interactions between the external forces on the system. CAS are easily found in natural systems and can analogously understood for enterprises. For example, think of a school of fish that are self-organizing to fend off larger predator fish and/or groups of starling swarms that form incredible visions in the sky while foraging for food. Alternatively, imagine difficult to predict traffic patterns that have the potential to be resolved by simple non-intuitive fixes.

Can enterprises be viewed as CAS? This is not straightforward as we are conditioned to view enterprises as “mechanistic” structure that have hierarchical structures with chained authority and power, and centralized decision-making. Nowhere is this more clearly visible than in military organizations. However, it is also easy to see how this view is highly limiting when it comes to organizational properties such as “innovation”, “resilience”, and ironically “leader-follower-ship”, which often take place “organically” within organizations.  As these properties become more sought after by stability seeking organizations, the CAS viewpoint begins to gain importance.

The CAS enterprise view has the potential to explain system properties such as “emergent behavior”, “self-organization”, “homeostasis”, and “adaptation”. Pragmatic applications of this view have been developed by scholars to understand the behavior of complex supply-chains [Choi et. al 2001](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0272-6963(00)00068-1);  [Novak et. al 2021](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jbl.12270?casa_token=_M-UEm5mDvAAAAAA:KsoHjtLLMQ3BLMcGNyBzEve8OmiSgsc3pL8NIg0SMnZQQj2jw7PY2j0ZDh9KKxKSswgLPR7znOjNyHJXuQ), economies [JH Holland 2002](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-50007-7_3), Business Models [Liu et. al 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lrp.2020.102030).  A paper briefly explains our conceptual approach in simulating enterprise self-organization. Furthermore, research at Innovation Science Lab on CAS theory to characterize business models as CAS provides a base for resilience. Furthermore, building enterprise resiliency needs understanding of risks as a complex network of interacting risk factors triggered by external events.

An ongoing study on risk networks adopts the CAS view in building a networked view of corporate risks. It is expected that this work will build a knowledge resource base useful to explain mechanisms of cascading risks and to predict the varying impacts of risk events on enterprises. The project is supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) [award #2049782](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2049782&HistoricalAwards=false). It serves national interest and is in alignment with NSF’s mission to promote the progress of science, and via that, advance national prosperity and welfare. In summary, the CAS view is perhaps the best alternative for use in viewing complex enterprises, especially as their complexity increases with time.
