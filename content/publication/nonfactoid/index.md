abstract: With the rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence, a question of emotional intelligence of a system may become as important as its accuracy. This paper investigates whether emotions should be considered for non-factoid “how” Question-Answering systems with the eventual goal of enabling the system to retrieve answers in a more emotionally intelligent way. This study proposes an architecture that adds extended representation of sentiment information to questions and answers, and reports on to what extent a prediction of the best answer be improved by the proposed architecture.
