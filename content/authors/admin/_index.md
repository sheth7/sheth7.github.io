I am a third year PhD Student at Purdue University, where I work on Natural Language Understanding with [Julia Taylor Rayz](https://polytechnic.purdue.edu/profile/taylo108) at the [AKRaNLU Lab](https://engineering.purdue.edu/AKRANLU/). I am particularly interested in analysing neural network representations of language from the perspective of human sentence processing. 

In 2018, I was fortunate to be funded by the Purdue Research Foundation Fellowship. I currently teach three sections (~75 students) of database fundamentals to sophomore level undergraduates.

I will soon be hosting virtual office hours for undergraduates interested in research. [Click here for updates]({{< ref "/misc/" >}}).
