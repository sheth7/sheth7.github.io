I am a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow working with the Consortium for Corporate Entrepreneurship at the School of Business, Stevens Institute of Technology. 

My research interests relate to [front-end Innovation](http://www.frontendinnovation.com/) in large incumbent firms and the strategic management of risk and growth to build enterprise resilience.

I graduated with a PhD from Purdue University's [Institute for Innovation Science](https://engineering.purdue.edu/Innovation/InnovationScience), where I worked with industry partners to better understand the tension between risk management and the growth goals of Fortune 50 enterprises.  I view [organizations as complex adaptive systems](https://www.anansheth.com/post/enterprises-are-complex-systems/) and frame a two-pronged route to resilience, which involves thinking of risks as complex networks; and innovating systematically as compared to serendipitously.  This view is honed through years of hypotheses testing and is supported by decision frameworks and computing tools to aid implementation.  

My dissertation was awarded a [grant by The National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2049782&HistoricalAwards=false), and chapters from it are published or forthcoming in top peer-reviewed journals.
