I am an Assistant Professor of Entrepreneurship at Cal Poly - San Luis Obispo. 

My research interests relate to understanding corporate innovation, entrepreneurship, and resilience in large established firms.

I graduated with a PhD from Purdue University's [Institute for Innovation Science](https://engineering.purdue.edu/Innovation/InnovationScience), where I worked with industry partners to better understand the tension between managing risk and growth of large complex enterprises.

My dissertation was awarded a [grant by The National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2049782&HistoricalAwards=false).
