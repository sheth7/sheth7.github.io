I am a PhD candidate at Purdue University's [Innovation Science Lab](https://engineering.purdue.edu/Innovation/about/innoscience). My work focuses on better understanding the tension between risk management and growth in enterprises with the objective of building resilient organizations.  Specific research interests include understanding enterprise risks as complex networks and pursuing systematic, repeatible innovation using an innovation toolkit.

A co-authored proposal to study enterprise risk management employing complexity theory is currently in review at the National Science Foundation.
