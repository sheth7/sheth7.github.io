abstract: Large incumbent firms pursue exploitatative and exploratory projects simultaneously.  Theirs is a portfolio  approach to innovation management and portfolios of exploratory innovation are termed Innovations Streams.  The theoretical view on exploitation - exploration however seems to be stuck in a dichotomy.  This has several implications for empirical works measuring a firm's innovativeness in terms of a high-level and non-nuanced dichotomy of innovation states.  So, we formulate a more-nuanced typology in terms of a firm's activities at its core business and non-core activities. We view innovation programs based on the uncertainty of their value-creation potential and mode of technology acquisition.  This view enables us to calibrate the distance of exploratory activities from the firm's core business  and bring forth an  interesting counter-intuitive notion on what constitutes core and non-core. Theoretically, it takes a firm-centric view of innovation portfolio management.  From a practitioner lens, it provides a more nuanced method to answer the "where to play?" question.
